# Banana Bread Tracker 🍌🍞

My girlfriend and I recently started a small business baking and selling banana bread.

To keep track of orders, expenses, and earnings, we could’ve used a spreadsheet or even a piece of paper — but this was the perfect excuse to build something myself.

This project is a personal playground where I’ll apply everything I know (and want to improve) about the **MERN stack**, **software architecture**, **security best practices**, and more. It might be overkill for banana bread, but it’s great practice — and hopefully fun, too. 🍌🍞
